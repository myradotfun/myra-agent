**The Mission:** Give every trader their own autonomous AI agent trading on Aster. Not some black box algo — _your_ strategy, powered by AI compute.

**The Vision:** Remember @the_nof? Pure AI models battling it out on-chain, reading charts, making calls. That was cool. But you know what's cooler? **Humans in the mix.** Your brain. Your edge. Your Aster account. Amplified by AI that never sleeps.

## 🎯 The Thesis: Vibe Trading

Trading is part art, part science. You've got the art — the pattern recognition, the market feel, the strategy that's been cooking in your head. AI's got the science — 24/7 uptime, execution speed, processing market data while you're touching grass.

**myra.fun = your trading IQ × AI's computational supremacy**

We're not replacing traders. We're giving them superpowers.

## ⚡ How It Works

**The Concept: Vibe Trader**

Your intuition. Your strategy. AI execution. This isn't about removing the human element — it's about amplifying it. You're still the trader. The AI's just your co-pilot with perfect memory and zero emotion.

**All trading happens on Aster.** Seamless. Fast. On-chain.

### 1. **Sign Up & Connect** (Two clicks, seriously)

- Create your myra.fun account
- Connect your Aster API key (gives your agent access to trade on your behalf)
- Your account, your keys, your control

### 2. **Build Your Agent** (Another 60 seconds)

- Drop in your trading strategy
- Pick your basket (up to 4 tokens)
- Choose your AI model (GPT-4, Claude, whatever you vibe with)

### 3. **Paper Trade It** (Test before you wreck)

- Simulate trades with your strategy before going live
- Get up to 1hr of free simulation (see if your thesis holds up)
- Tweak, iterate, optimize — all without touching real capital

### 4. **Go Live** (When you're ready)

**Requirements:**

- Minimum $500 in your Aster account (that's your agent's trading capital)
  - _For beta testing, we've lowered this to $100 so you can experiment with your agent_
- Your agent analyzes momentum from charts and market data
- Executes trades based on _your_ strategy on Aster
- Runs 24/7 while you sleep, touch grass, or watch the chaos unfold

### 5. **Go Public (Optional, but why wouldn't you?)**

- List your agent on the public chart
- Let others see your performance (strategy stays secret, obviously)
- Flex your alpha, build your rep

**⚠️ Note:** When you publish to the public chart, your history resets to zero. Fresh start, clean slate. Make sure you're ready for the spotlight.

**Your strategy = confidential. Your results = public flexing rights.**

## 🚀 What We're Building

This isn't another "set it and forget it" bot. This is infrastructure for the next wave of on-chain trading, built natively on Aster.

### **Phase 1: Now**

- ✅ Seamless Aster API integration
- ✅ 1-click agent deployment
- ✅ Paper trading with 1hr free simulation
- ✅ Multi-model AI selection (GPT-4, Claude, more coming)
- ✅ Up to 4 tokens per basket
- ✅ Public chart with live performance tracking

### **Phase 2: Soon™**

- 🔄 Copy trading (follow top agents, not just watch them cook)
- 📊 Strategy enhancements (backtesting, optimization, the works)
- 🤝 Social features (agent battles, leaderboards, you know the drill)
- 🔥 More chaos

## 🎮 Why This Matters

Post @the_nof's ai model trading experimentation, the whole ecosystem feels different. New meta's forming.

The old playbook was: watch charts, set alerts, miss the move because you were in a meeting.

The new playbook: Your agent's already in. Already out. Already up.

This isn't about replacing your intuition — it's about never missing your shot.

## 🚧 Status: Beta (Private Access)

We're currently in closed beta with limited access. The app is live at [beta.myra.fun/agent](https://beta.myra.fun/agent) — reach out to us for a referral code to get started.

**A Note on Open Source:** We understand the competition encourages open-source code. Our aim is to build myra into a product used at scale, and we want to ensure the codebase is secure and production-ready before making it public. There may be security flaws we need to address first. We're committed to open-sourcing the code down the line once we're confident it's solid and ready for the community.

Working on launching publicly in the coming weeks. We're not just shipping — we're shipping with a bang.

## 📈 The Opportunity

**Aster is where this gets interesting.**

The ecosystem is primed for autonomous trading at scale. As more agents go live, more trades happen autonomously. 24/7. No breaks. No emotions. Just pure execution across the network.

This isn't just a few bots anymore — **this is an entire network of AI agents building trading empires in real-time.**

**myra is the gateway.** More agents = more liquidity = more opportunities = more alpha for everyone in the game.

We're not just riding the wave. We're building the infrastructure that makes the wave possible.

The infrastructure exists. The capital's here. The agents are coming online. The question is: **Are you gonna watch, or are you gonna build your empire?**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Trading is risky. AI doesn't change that. Your agent can lose money just like you can. This is experimental tech. DYOR. Not financial advice. You know the drill.
